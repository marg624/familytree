## Data Source

The family tree data is sourced from this Google Spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QyYByrlq1aPp_jyI2FW4AD5DQGQhlJ_FXxmICXKb80/edit

Each family spreadsheet should have two tabs:
- **People**: Contains family member details (ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Birth_Date, Death_Date, Birth_Place)
- **Relationship**: Contains relationships between people (Person1_ID, Person2_ID, Relationship_Type)

## Required Spreadsheet Format

### People Tab:
| ID | First_Name | Last_Name | Birth_Date | Death_Date | Birth_Place | Photo_URL |
|----|------------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Fortunato (Tato) | Campana | | | | https://example.com/photo1.jpg |
| 2 | Basilia | Acuna | | | | |

### Relationship Tab:
| Person1_ID | Person2_ID | Relationship_Type |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 2 | spouse |
| 1 | 3 | parent |

**Notes:**
- First_Name can include nicknames in parentheses
- Photo_URL is optional - add direct links to photos (Google Drive, etc.)
- Relationship_Type should be: "parent", "spouse"
- Only one row needed per relationship (no reverse rows)

- **7+ Generation Support**: Handles great-great-grandparents and beyond
- **Comprehensive Relationships**: Supports all standard family relationships:
  - Direct: parent, child, sibling, spouse
  - Extended: grandparent, great-grandparent, aunt/uncle, niece/nephew
  - Cousins: 1st cousin, 2nd cousin, 3rd cousin, etc.
  - Removed: cousin 1x removed, cousin 2x removed, etc.
  - Complex: in-laws, half-siblings, step-relationships
- **Interactive Finder**: Dedicated tool to find relationships between any two people
- **Real-time Context**: Shows relationships in person detail panels

## Relationship Examples

The relationship calculator can determine complex family connections:

### Simple Relationships
- **Basilia** to **Hilaria**: `grandparent` (parent's parent)
- **Tranquilino** to **Fortunato**: `grandchild` (child's child)
- **Isabel** to **Tomasa**: `sibling` (same parents)

### Complex Relationships  
- **Cousins**: People with same grandparents are 1st cousins
- **2nd Cousins**: People with same great-grandparents are 2nd cousins
- **Removed Cousins**: A cousin's child is "1x removed" (one generation difference)
- **Great Relations**: Great-grandparent, great-great-grandparent, etc.

### In-Law Relationships
- Spouse's family members are marked as "in-law"
- Half-siblings (sharing one parent) are marked as "half"

### Usage
1. Click the **"Relationships"** button in the family tree
2. Search for two people using the dropdown menus
3. See their relationship instantly calculated
4. Click on any person in detail panels to see their relationships

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser

4. Enter the family password: `hilaria`

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching**: The app fetches family data from the public Google Spreadsheet using CSV export
- **Tree Building**: Relationships are processed to create parent-child and spouse connections
- **Interactive Display**: Family members are displayed in an expandable tree structure
- **Detail Panel**: Click any person to see their detailed information in a side panel

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Vercel at: https://familytree-miranda.vercel.app/

To deploy updates:
1. Push changes to the main branch
2. Vercel will automatically build and deploy

## Adding New Family Spreadsheets

To add Guerrero and Miranda family spreadsheets:
1. Create new Google Spreadsheets with the same format as the Campana spreadsheet
2. Update the spreadsheet IDs in `/src/lib/sheetsApi.js`:
```javascript
const FAMILY_SPREADSHEETS = {
  campana: '18QyYByrlq1aPp_jyI2FW4AD5DQGQhlJ_FXxmICXKb80',
  guerrero: 'YOUR_GUERRERO_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE',
  miranda: 'YOUR_MIRANDA_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE'
};
```
